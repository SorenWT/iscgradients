# This repository contains code for the paper "Individual differences in naturalistic viewing revealed through dimensionality reduction of inter-subject correlation matrices", submitted to NEUR608 at McGill University by Soren Wainio-Theberge (Fall 2020)

All the code for the analyses in the paper is in two scripts: iscscript.m and make_word_regressors.m. The rest comes from the (many) dependencies:

- Fieldtrip (https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip)
- BrainSpace (https://github.com/MICA-MNI/BrainSpace)
- SPM12 (https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/)
- The raw data from Finn et al. (2020) (https://github.com/esfinn/intersubj_rsa)
- Panel (for plotting figures: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/20003-panel)
- and last but not least, my own Frankenstein's monster of a Functions repository (https://github.com/SorenWT/Functions)

Each of these needs to be added to the path and set up properly for this to work. The Functions repository should be added with all subfolders.
Code was run in MATLAB R2020a with all toolboxes, so if a function is missing for you, it may be an obscure MATLAB toolbox function.
