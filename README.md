# This repository contains code for the paper "Individual differences in naturalistic viewing revealed through dimensionality reduction of inter-subject correlation matrices", submitted to NEUR608 at McGill University by Soren Wainio-Theberge (Fall 2020)

All the code for the analyses in the paper is in two scripts: iscscript.m and make_word_regressors.m. The rest comes from the (many) dependencies:

- Fieldtrip (https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip)
- BrainSpace (https://github.com/MICA-MNI/BrainSpace)
- SPM12 (https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/)
- Panel (for plotting figures: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/20003-panel)
- and last but not least, my own Frankenstein's monster of a Functions repository (https://github.com/SorenWT/Functions)

Each of these needs to be added to the path and set up properly for this to work. 
Code was run in MATLAB R2020a with all toolboxes, so if a function is missing, it may be an obscure MATLAB toolbox function.
